= Rack::SslEnforcer

Rack::SslEnforcer is a simple Rack middleware to enforce ssl connections. As of Version 0.2.0, Rack::SslEnforcer marks
Cookies as secure and enables HSTS by default.


== Installation

  gem install rack-ssl-enforcer


== Usage

  require 'rack-ssl-enforcer'
  use Rack::SslEnforcer

This will redirect all requests to SSL. Rack::SslEnforcer accepts params:

You might need the :redirect_to option if the requested URL can't be determined (e.g. if using a proxy).

  use Rack::SslEnforcer, :redirect_to => 'https://example.org'
  
You can also define specific regex patterns or paths to redirect.
  
  use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only => /^\/admin\//
  use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only => "/login"
  use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only => ["/login", /\.xml$/]
  
And force http for non-https path

  use Rack::SslEnforcer, :only => ["/login", /\.xml$/], :strict => true

To set HSTS expiry and subdomain inclusion (defaults: one year, true)

	use Rack::SslEnforcer, :hsts => {:expires => 500, :subdomains => false}

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, 
  that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
